Due to the species now detected in the Saint John River, NB there is a greater risk of introduction and further dispersal throughout the Saint John River tributaries and to other non-invaded systems.",3,"DFO completed a detailed-level risk assessment of D. polymorpha risk of introduction and establishment for all of Canada including sub-drainages throughout Atlantic Canada. Based on Table A1 (DFO 2024), all of New Burnswick, PEI and much of Nova Scotia are considered at high risk of invasion.  Due to D. polymorpha having a wider tolerance to lower calcium concentrations and shallower depth profiles than D. burgensis this species is even more likely to establish in areas of high conservation, economic, or recreational value.",3,"Species is likely to impact native species, especially native mussel species through direct inter-species competition, D. polymorpha settlement onto native mussel shells, changes in light penetration, and decreased food availability for other filter feeders (e.g. gastropods and mussels) (DFO 2024).",3,"This species impacts multiple trophic levels which lead to trophic cascades, food web shifts, and loss of biodiversity. Additionally, the species fouls beaches and water in-take pipes that causes further human-related impacts to water fow regimes and recreational water use (DFO 2024).",12,"Yes","No","Yes","Given the species new detections within the assessment area, further research should be done to determine vector activity and risk.","Zebra mussel","Mollusc","AISR","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes",NA
